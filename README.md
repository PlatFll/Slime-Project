A small game I was working on , It's a game where the player is a slime jumping and climbing up as many platforms/floors as possible while avoiding various hazards like enemies and traps trying to achieve as high a score as possible.
The idea was to be a replayable endless-type game where the player would try over and over to go as far as possible and reach the highest score possible , The platforms would be randomly generated by the platform generator I made where I'd insert multiple pre-fabs of hand-made platforms and they all get randomly stacked on top of one another and deleting previous floors at a certain distance below the player to save up space.
